----------------------------------
* Made a change to the PresentationModel AspectJ approach. 
It is now required to explicitly define a PresentationModelChangeSupport field in a presentation model 
in order to use the methods like firePropertyChange("propertyName");
* Made a minor change to proguard config.
* Clean up the javadocs. Now it only includes the public APIs.
* Upgraded framework and all sample projects to Gradle build.
* Upgraded to Robolectric 2.3 for tests.
