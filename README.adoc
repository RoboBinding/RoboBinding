A data-binding http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/PresentationModel.html[Presentation Model](MVVM) framework for the Android platform. 
RoboBinding helps you write UI code that is easier to read, test and maintain without performance compromise(code generation instead of java reflection).

* removes - *lots of unnecessary code(e.g., addXXListener(), findViewById()...)* - by binding.

* turns - *hard to unit tests and Android unit tests running for ages which makes unit tests impractical* - into *pure POJO PresentationModels* with normal JUnit tests.

* provides the object cursor as a replacement to - *the relational cursor but we are used to operating objects*.

* it is easy to implement attribute bindings for any custom components, third-party components or Android widgets, which simplifies the code and produces more maintainable code base.

Let's watch http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/os-mobile-server/core-dev-talk-robobinding[an introductory video] and then get started from link:http://robobinding.org/getting_started.html[here].

RoboBinding values *code quality*. The framework source code is very readable and comes with a complete set of tests,
which makes contributing easy and enjoyable. Want contributing? start link:http://robobinding.org/insight_into_framework.html#_set_up_eclipse_development_environment[here].
